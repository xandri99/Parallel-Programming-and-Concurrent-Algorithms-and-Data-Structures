# Parallel Programming and Concurrent Algorithms and Data Structures

## Overview

This repository hosts a collection of exercises and projects developed for courses on parallel programming and concurrent algorithms and data structures at Uppsala University. The contents are tailored to provide practical experience and in-depth knowledge of developing efficient, parallel, and concurrent software systems.

## Content Description

The repository is structured around various topics within parallel programming and concurrent data structures, including but not limited to:

- Introduction to Parallel Programming
- Concurrent Algorithms and Data Structures

Each directory contains specific exercises or projects. The exercises are designed to reinforce theoretical concepts with practical implementation challenges.

## Getting Started

To use the exercises and projects in this repository, you will need:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later.
- Basic understanding of parallel programming concepts and C++.

Instructions for compiling and running each project or exercise can be found within the individual directories.
